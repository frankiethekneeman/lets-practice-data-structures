# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I'm not planning to use SemVer in this project.  The goal is to get it to a place that it can be a template repository.

This project is not intended for use in production system - it does not export anything, and should not be depended upon.

However, I will still endeavor to keep latest master clear of security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use github issues to report security vulnerabilities if you find them.  There's no company behind this repo, so I can't
exactly offer bug bounties - sorry.  If you have time to fix them, I'll happily accept your PRs though.
